# mb2-mic-on: lowâ€¦high level Rust pin-setting
Bart Massey 2024

This code turns on the MicroBit v2 microphone (and thus its
"mic on" LED) for about three seconds, at varying levels of
abstraction:

* `raw`: Uses arithmetic and the manual.
* `structured`: Hooray, subroutines.
* `pac`: Uses `nrf52833-pac`.
* `hal`: Uses `nrf52833-hal`.
* `board`: Uses `microbit-v2`.

You will need to build the pre-`hal` code with `--release`
to get the timing right.

These [setup](./SETUP.md) commands will get your Linux box
set up to run this stuff. Similar things for other platforms.
